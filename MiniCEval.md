# Breaking Down MiniC

As stated in the docs the `MiniC` pipeline goes as follows:

```bash
miniC pgm -> Lexer -> Parser -> Typechcker -> Name -> Lift -> Control -> Codegen -> MIPS pgm
```

Let's break this down step by step for the following intentionally simplistic program called `basic.mc`:

```c
int main() {
  int a;
  a = 1 + 2;
  print a;
	return a;
}
```

As you can see, this program has one function (main, required) that simply creates a variable `a` and prints it's value after adding `1 + 2`. The print statement is so we can see the result in the command line, which technically isn't required.

## Makerfile

When we call `make` from our project root it goes into the Makerfile and runs the following code:

```ocaml
SOURCES = util.ml symbol.ml label.ml typ.ml basis.ml env.ml ast.ml \
		  lexer.ml debug.ml parser.ml \
          staticbasis.ml static.ml \
		  name.ml lift.ml copyprop.ml \
          quads.ml control.ml copyprop_quads.ml \
		  mips.ml dynamicbasis.ml codegen.ml \
          compile.ml 

PACKS = unix
INCDIRS = ~/cs3366/lib/
LIBS = code
RESULT = mc
OCAMLMAKEFILE = ~/.opam/default/lib/ocaml-makefile/OCamlMakefile
include $(OCAMLMAKEFILE)
```

This is what ultimately creates our executuble `mc` file that we run for the program. We can see in our sources input we define all of the files, and the program presumably starts in the `compile.ml` file. 

**Question for Muller: does this just run through each source and run everything, but compile.mc is the only file with an actual function call so it starts the process then?**

## Compile.ml

### Part 1 - Setup

At the end of this file on Line 134 we can see compile function is called with `let () = compile ()`. Diving into the function line by line we start with:

```ocaml
let n = compilerOptions () in
```

This runs the compilerOptions() function which counts the number of system arguments given to the program and returns the position where the source file should be. If there are two items, then in position 0 is the program invocation and position 1 is the position of the source file. If there are 3 arguments we check whether it's one of the supported parameters (-nocheck or -t). If it is, it appears that we are modifying some global variables (`typeChecking` in the current `compile.ml` file, and `debugLexer` in the `Debug.ml` file). These are both declared as pointers with the `ref` keyword. If there are more than 3 arguments or no match, then the program fails immediately with an argument error.

**Question for Muller, why isn't compilerOptions (and other helpers) in the .mli file?**

### Part 2 - System Args

Straightforward getting of the filename using the place we just determined:

```ocaml
let filename = Sys.argv.(n) in
```

### Part 3 - Debugging

Using another reference, we then modify the `debugSetup` variable in `Debug.ml` . This is the `stdout` and presumbly is what creates the resulting `basic.dbg` file.

```ocaml
let dbgOut = Debug.debugSetup filename in
```

### Part 4 - Enviroment Creation

We now need to create the base type environment:

```ocaml
let typeEnv = Env.make Staticbasis.operatorTypes in
```

This runs the function `make` in the `Env.ml` file and passes in `Staticbasis.operatorTypes`. Looking at the paramter first, `operatorTypes` defines all of the required types for operators. The supported operaters are:  +, -, *, /, %, **, <, <=, ==, <>, >=, >, not. These operators all accept two `int`'s and the output is either an `int` or a `bool`, classified as one would assume. The outlier case is the `not` operator, which goes from a bool to a bool. Each operator is then associated with one of the functions `intCrossInt2Int`, `intCrossInt2Bool`, or `bool2Bool`.

Overall this is the paramter than is going to be passed to our Env to create the enviroment. This adheres closely to our defined grammer and typing checking we have layed out.

**Question for Muller: where specifically in our grammar is this? Trying to visual the translation from definition to code hereâ€¦is this all just matching up with the operator definition and then typing checking with injection tags?**

**Personal note: practice the conversions with this again, review problem on the test**

Now inside of the Env make function we have:

```ocaml
  let make values =
  	let folder map (key, value) = add key value map in
  	let keyValuePairs = List.combine Basis.primOps values
  	in
 	List.fold_left folder empty keyValuePairs 
```

This is slightly difficult to understand, but it's seemingly created a key value map between the Basis.primOps and the values we are inputting (remembering that these values are the `Staticbasis.operatorTypes` from above. As we look into the `Basis.ml` file we see a list of the same operations we have defined in Staticbasis.

**Question for Muller: why is there the seperation between `Staticbasis.ml` and `Basis.ml`. Is this because `Basis.ml` is going to be applied both for the static and dynamic implementations? To make sure I understand, your comment says that `makeBasis` can be applied to `list implementationsOfPrimitives` to make the dynamic basis. This dynamic basis is basically a type checker/guarentee for the functions that a user may be defining? And the static basis is for the built in operators that we already know?**

### Part 5 - Parsing/Lexing

Back in the `compile.ml`file, we now have line 53 which is:

```ocaml
let ast = parseFile filename in
```

As we did in previous homeworks we are parsing the input file text into an `ast` that we can then manipulate. Out of curiosity, here is the parseFile function:

```ocaml let parseFile fileName =
  let inch = open_in fileName in
  let lexbuf = Lexing.from_channel inch in
  let ast = (if !Debug.debugLexer then
               let _ = Debug.dumpTokens Lexer.token lexbuf
               in
               Ast.Program([])
             else
               Parser.program Lexer.token lexbuf)
  in
  close_in inch ;
  ast 
```

This uses the the `open_in` [function](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Pervasives.html) to open a new file stream and the input file is then run through the Lexer/Parse to make a TokenStream and finally after closing the stream it returns the generate AST. The `Parser.ml` and `Lexar.ml` files are both auto-genearted as discussed in class.

### Part 6 - Debugging File

We then run the line:

```ocaml
let _ = Debug.debugInfo(dbgOut, "The input program is:", ast) in
```

The notation `let _` simply denotes that we know we are not going to use whatever is returned, but we need to assign it some name. I believe this line only matters if Debug is set to false, in which case it will simply write out to the debug file immediately with just the name of the file. 

**Questions for Muller:**

**A) it seems when I try to run the command: `./mc -t basic.mc` I'm getting the error `Fatal error: exception Failure("main() not found")`**

**B) Any reason for requiring the system args `-t` and `-nocheck` before the file? Most programs seem to accept optional requirements after the required input**

### Part 7 - Static Type Checking

```ocaml
  (* See if the user wants this program typed-checked. *)
  let _ = (if !typeChecking then
             let msg = (try
                          let _ = Static.typeCheck typeEnv ast
                          in
                          "\nThe program is well-typed.\n"
                        with Static.TypeError s ->
                          let _ = print_string s in
                          let _ = Util.writeln(dbgOut, 0, s)
                          in
                          failwith "Compilation failed.\n")
             in
             (if !Debug.debug then Util.writeln(dbgOut, 0, msg) else ())
           else
             (* No type checking, pretend the program was well-typed. *)
             ()) in
```

**Question for Muller: I must be reading this wrong, but it looks like the if statement is only proceeding if "typeChecking" is equal to `false`, whereas if it is equal to `true` then it will jump to else clause which says "No type checking"?** 

Here we are checking if the variable we originally set in Part 1 is false, if it is false then due to the bang operator (not sure the OCaml term). If it's true, it will jump to the else clause which does nothing. Inside of the message variable we are passing the `typeEnv` we built in Part 4 along with the `ast` we made in Part 5 into the `Static.typeCheck` funciton.

The `Static.typeCheck` function is where all of the type checking occurs that we've covered briefly in previous problem sets. This similarily matches up fairly closely with the grammer we have defined and goes recursively through the `ast` after creating a new `env'`.  The result of this is all within a `try/with` statement that will either pass or fail. If it passes then the message "The program is well-typed." will be printed into the debug file (assuming debug is turned on).

### Part 8 - Checking for Main Function

```ocaml
  (* Check for the presence of main function *)
  let Program ps = ast in
  let _ =
    match List.exists (fun (Ast.Procedure Ast.{id; formals}) ->
        Symbol.format id = "main" && formals = []) ps with
    | true -> ()
    | false -> failwith "main() not found"
  in
```

**Question for Muller: what does that first line "Program ps" mean, it's changing the type of the ast into a Program? Why can't we just use the ast and change the function to accept an ast, not a program? Additionally, why must the formals be true/what is that representing?"**

We now check if inside the Ast we have a function called `main`. We are mapping the `Program ps` over the lambda function to get out every procedures `ids` which are then checked with the name "main". Assuming it is true, do nothing, otherwise failwith it not being found.

### Part 9 - Naming

```ocaml
  (* Perform the naming source-to-source transformation.*)
  let named = Name.translate ast in
  let _ = Debug.debugInfo(dbgOut, "After the naming phase:", named) in
```

Now into the core of the compiler, the first step of which is naming. We simply pass the ast into the Naming translation function. Here it goes:

```ocaml
let rec translate (Ast.Program procedures) =
  Ast.Program (List.map translateProcedure procedures)
```

Start by mapping all of the `ast` procedures over the function `translateProcedure`:

```ocaml
and translateProcedure (Ast.Procedure {id; formals; typ; body}) =
  Ast.Procedure {id; formals; typ; body= translateStatement body}
```

This `translateProcedure` function accepts a Procedure and gives us access to it's inner components, which as we can see we are actually returning, except upon the return we are passing the `body` to the function `translateStatement`:

```ocaml
and translateStatement statement =
  match statement with
  | Ast.Block {decls; statements} ->
      Ast.Block {decls; statements= List.map translateStatement statements}
  | Ast.Assign {id; expr} -> Ast.Assign {id; expr= translateTerm expr}
  | Ast.While {expr; statement} ->
      Ast.While
        {expr= translateTerm expr; statement= translateStatement statement}
  | Ast.IfS {expr; thn; els} ->
      Ast.IfS
        { expr= translateTerm expr
        ; thn= translateStatement thn
        ; els= translateStatement els }
  | Ast.Call {rator; rands} ->
      Ast.Call {rator; rands= List.map translateTerm rands}
  | Ast.Print term -> Ast.Print (translateTerm term)
  | Ast.Return term -> Ast.Return (translateTerm term)
```

This function takes the statement and matches it with the potential statement types defined in `Ast.ml`, which are Block, Assign, While, IfS, Call, Print, Return. Each of these statements are then either compromised of a `term` or `statement`, which are applied to the functions `translateTerm` and `translateStatement`, respectively.

**Question for Muller: we seem to be calling `translateStatement` within `translateStatement`, but `translateStatement` isn't defined as being recursive?**

`translateTerm`:

```ocaml
and translateTerm term =
  match term with
  | Ast.Id _ as i -> i
  | Ast.Literal _ as w -> w
  | Ast.If {expr; thn; els} ->
      Ast.If
        { expr= translateTerm expr
        ; thn= translateTerm thn
        ; els= translateTerm els }
  | Ast.Or {left; right} ->
      (* FREE CODE Removes OR *)
      let x = Symbol.fresh () in
      let expr = Ast.Id x in
      let bv = {Ast.id= x; typ= Typ.Bool} in
      Ast.Let
        { decl= Ast.ValBind {bv; defn= translateTerm left}
        ; body= Ast.If {expr; thn= expr; els= translateTerm right} }
  | Ast.And {left; right} ->
      (* FREE CODE Removes AND *)
      let x = Symbol.fresh () in
      let expr = Ast.Id x in
      let bv = {Ast.id= x; typ= Typ.Bool} in
      Ast.Let
        { decl= Ast.ValBind {bv; defn= translateTerm left}
        ; body= Ast.If {expr; thn= translateTerm right; els= expr} }
  | Ast.App {rator; rands} ->
      (* build list of fresh variables for existing operands *)
      let decl_var _ = Symbol.fresh () in
      let vars = List.map decl_var rands in
      (* function that wraps ast with
              Let var = value in ast *)
      let createTreeRight var value ast =
        let var_typ = Typ.Int (*********** FIX **************) in
        Ast.Let
          { decl=
              Ast.ValBind
                {bv= {id= var; typ= var_typ}; defn= translateTerm value}
          ; body= ast }
      in
      (* expr_var is the extra Symbol for the result of this Ast.App tree *)
      let expr_var = Symbol.fresh () in
      (* for mapping Symbol.t list "vars" to Ast.term list *)
      let to_term var = Ast.Id var in
      List.fold_right2 createTreeRight vars rands
        (Ast.Let
           { decl=
               Ast.ValBind
                 { bv= {id= expr_var; typ= Typ.Int}
                 ; defn= Ast.App {rator; rands= List.map to_term vars} }
           ; body= to_term expr_var })
  | Ast.Let {decl= Ast.ValBind {bv; defn}; body} ->
      Ast.Let {decl= Ast.ValBind {bv; defn}; body= translateTerm body}
```

We consistently use `Symbol.fresh()` to generate fresh variable names through this code. In each match statement we taking in the Ast and returning back a new Ast with a renamed variable, should a variable exist. As we see with literal and id, we just return as is. Diving into the `Ast.App` match statement, we map all of the `rands` acros the `decl_var` function which generates a new variable name for each, now called `vars`.

 We now define the function `createTreeRight` which takes in a `var` `value` and `ast `(diving in shortly). After that we make a function value called `expr_var` that will return fresh Symbols once called. Now we say that within the coming function, `to_term var` will equal `Ast.Id var`. This is seemingly matching up all of the `Ast.Id` with vars now.

The main working function here is:

```ocaml
List.fold_right2 createTreeRight vars rands
        (Ast.Let
           { decl=
               Ast.ValBind
                 { bv= {id= expr_var; typ= Typ.Int}
                 ; defn= Ast.App {rator; rands= List.map to_term vars} }
           ; body= to_term expr_var })
```

Which takes three inputs, `createTreeRight vars rands Ast.let(â€¦)`. This generally appears to be mapping all of the variables inside of a `Let` statement with new variable names for all of their rands.

**Questions for Muller: A) We didn't want to run this on the entire program because we want to keep some of the original variable names for debugging purposes? B) I'm struggling to understand what is actually happening in the above statement and how `List.fold_right2` words. Docs for my reference: <http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/List.html>**

### Part 10 - Lifting

We now passed the `ast` that the naming phase returns into the `lifting` function.
